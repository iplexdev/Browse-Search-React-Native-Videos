# Browse/Search React Native Videos

you can use whatever frameworks youâ€™d like. we use React here at drift and have found create-react-app to be a great way to get started.

To get started :

docs: ```https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started```

apikey: ```generate your own in the google api console```

sample request:
```
https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?key=`generate your own in the google api console`=snippet&type=video&q=react native
```

## Min Requirements
  - have a home page that lists and either paginates or infinite scrolls react native videos
  - allow videos to be opened in a new page to play
  - allow search within the category (ex: q = react native + query)
  - show description/title/thumbnail per video on home page

## Extra credit
  - show comments on video detail page
  - show videos from same author on detail page
  - allow for sorting and advanced filtering on home page
  - make it sexy
  - go crazy with available end points :)
